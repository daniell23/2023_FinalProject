                            the<span>&nbsp;</span>United States<span>&nbsp;</span>of America. It was admitted to the
                            union as the 37th state on March 1, 1867. <strong>Nebraska</strong> is bounded by the state
                            of<span>&nbsp;</span>South Dakota<span>&nbsp;</span>to the north, with
                            the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Missouri River</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>making up about
                            one-fourth of that boundary and the whole of <strong>Nebraska&rsquo;s</strong> boundaries
                            with the states

                            the east. The boundary with<span>&nbsp;</span>Kansas<span>&nbsp;</span>to the south was
                            established when the two territories were created by
                            the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Kansas-Nebraska</strong> Act<span>&nbsp;</span>in 1854. In the
                            southwestern part of the state, the boundary
                            with<span>&nbsp;</span>Colorado<span>&nbsp;</span>forms a right angle (south and west),
                            which creates <strong>Nebraska&rsquo;s</strong> panhandle, to the west of which is the
                            boundary with<span>&nbsp;</span>Wyoming.<span>&nbsp;</span>Lincoln, in the southeastern part
                            of the state, is the capital.</p>
                        <p class="topic-paragraph">As one of the west-central states of the United States,
                            <strong>Nebraska</strong> was primarily a stopover point for
                            those<span>&nbsp;</span>migrating<span>&nbsp;</span>to the rich trapping country to the
                            north and west as well as to the settlement and mining frontiers of the mountain and Pacific
                            regions during the first half of the 19th century. With the development of railroads after
                            the<span>&nbsp;</span>American Civil War<span>&nbsp;</span>(1861&ndash;65) and the
                            consequent immigration, the fertile soils of <strong>Nebraska</strong> were plowed, and its
                            grasslands gave rise to a range cattle industry. As a result, the state has been a major
                            food producer since statehood.

                        <p class="topic-paragraph">Rivers have been important to <strong>Nebraska&rsquo;s</strong>
                            geography and settlement. A majority of <strong>Nebraskans</strong> live close to

                            populated. The Missouri was a major highway to the trans-Mississippi West in the early 19th
                            century. The Platte River has also played a significant role in
                            <strong>Nebraska&rsquo;s</strong> history. In fact, the state&rsquo;s name is derived from
                            the<span>&nbsp;</span>Oto<span>&nbsp;</span>Indian<span>&nbsp;</span>word
                            <strong>Nebrathka</strong> (&ldquo;Flat Water&rdquo;), a reference to the Platte. Area
                            77,347 square miles (200,329 square km). Population (2020) 1,961,504; (2022 est.) 1,967,923.
