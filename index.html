        <h2>Welcome to Explore Nebraska!</h2>
        <p>This is an interactive map for exploring the elevation and slope along several essential highways across the Nebraska State. In our map, you can click the specific highway you want to explore and can check the elevation and slope attribute for every point along the highway. Furthermore, you can use the search function to relocate, and use the people function to view the environment around the highway, etc. </p>
        <p>When you scroll down, you can find more information about the physical landscape information about Nebraska. Hope you can find interesting things and always exploring!</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><strong>Nebraska</strong>,<span>&nbsp;</span>constituent<span>&nbsp;</span>state<span>&nbsp;</span>of
            the<span>&nbsp;</span>United States<span>&nbsp;</span>of America. It was admitted to the
            union as the 37th state on March 1, 1867. <strong>Nebraska</strong> is bounded by the state
            of<span>&nbsp;</span>South Dakota<span>&nbsp;</span>to the north, with
            the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Missouri River</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>making up about
            one-fourth of that boundary and the whole of <strong>Nebraska&rsquo;s</strong> boundaries
            with the states
            of<span>&nbsp;</span>Iowa<span>&nbsp;</span>and<span>&nbsp;</span>Missouri<span>&nbsp;</span>to
            the east. The boundary with<span>&nbsp;</span>Kansas<span>&nbsp;</span>to the south was
            established when the two territories were created by
            the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Kansas-Nebraska</strong> Act<span>&nbsp;</span>in 1854. In the
            southwestern part of the state, the boundary
            with<span>&nbsp;</span>Colorado<span>&nbsp;</span>forms a right angle (south and west),
            which creates <strong>Nebraska&rsquo;s</strong> panhandle, to the west of which is the
            boundary with<span>&nbsp;</span>Wyoming.<span>&nbsp;</span>Lincoln, in the southeastern part
            of the state, is the capital.<br>
        <br>As one of the west-central states of the United States,
            <strong>Nebraska</strong> was primarily a stopover point for
            those<span>&nbsp;</span>migrating<span>&nbsp;</span>to the rich trapping country to the
            north and west as well as to the settlement and mining frontiers of the mountain and Pacific
            regions during the first half of the 19th century. With the development of railroads after
            the<span>&nbsp;</span>American Civil War<span>&nbsp;</span>(1861&ndash;65) and the
            consequent immigration, the fertile soils of <strong>Nebraska</strong> were plowed, and its
            grasslands gave rise to a range cattle industry. As a result, the state has been a major
            food producer since statehood. <br>
        <br>Rivers have been important to <strong>Nebraska&rsquo;s</strong>
            geography and settlement. A majority of <strong>Nebraskans</strong> live close to
            the<span>&nbsp;</span><span
            id="ref614963"></span>Missouri<span>&nbsp;</span>and<span>&nbsp;</span><span
            id="ref614207"></span>Platte<span>&nbsp;</span>rivers, leaving much of the state lightly
            populated. The Missouri was a major highway to the trans-Mississippi West in the early 19th
            century. The Platte River has also played a significant role in
            <strong>Nebraska&rsquo;s</strong> history. In fact, the state&rsquo;s name is derived from
            the<span>&nbsp;</span>Oto<span>&nbsp;</span>Indian<span>&nbsp;</span>word
            <strong>Nebrathka</strong> (&ldquo;Flat Water&rdquo;), a reference to the Platte. Area
            77,347 square miles (200,329 square km). Population (2020) 1,961,504; (2022 est.) 1,967,923.

        <p class="paragraph2">Nebraska<span>&nbsp;</span>comprises<span>&nbsp;</span>parts of two of the United
            States&rsquo; principal physiographic regions&mdash;the till plains of the Central Lowland (in the eastern third
            of the state) and the<span>&nbsp;</span>Great Plains<span>&nbsp;</span>(which makes up the centre of the state).<br>
        <br>The<span>&nbsp;</span><span id="ref799667"></span>Sand Hills<span>&nbsp;</span>region of
            north-central and northwestern Nebraska is one of the state&rsquo;s most distinctive
            features.<span>&nbsp;</span>Comprising<span>&nbsp;</span>nearly one-fourth of the area of the state, it consists
            of sloping hills and valleys varying from 25 to 400 feet (8 to 120 metres) in elevation. With many small lakes
            and luxuriant grasses, the Sand Hills area is a superb rangeland.<br>
        <br>Elevation in Nebraska rises from a minimum of 840 feet (256 metres)
            above<span>&nbsp;</span>sea level<span>&nbsp;</span>in the southeast to a maximum of 5,426 feet (1,654 metres)
            near the Colorado and Wyoming boundaries. Much of the land is gently rolling<span>&nbsp;</span>prairie, although
            the river valleys, much of south-central Nebraska, and a large portion of the panhandle district are flatlands.
