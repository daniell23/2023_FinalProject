### Final Proposal
1. <b>Persona/Scenario</b>
    1. <b>Persona</b>
        <b>Name & Position:</b>  Daniel Smith, Farmer who lives in Nebraska<br>
        <b>Background Description:</b> Daniel Smith is a fourth-generation farmer who lives and works in Nebraska. He is deeply connected to the land and is committed to sustainable and responsible farming practices. Daniel is interested in using a <b>one-way learning </b>interactive terrain map to better <b>identify</b> and <b>compare</b> the terrain of his farm and the surrounding area. He would like to be able to use the map to identify areas with higher elevations, erosion <b>trends</b>,  slopes, or drainage <b>patterns</b> that could impact his planting decisions and overall farm management.
        Daniel is also interested in understanding more about the natural resources and terrain changes in his area. He would like to be able to use the map to <b>identify</b> areas of erosion area which will affect his farming plans and learn more about the local conservation programs and initiatives that are in place. In this case, he can better understand how to protect his homeland and support his land sustainable. 


    2. <b>Scenario</b><br>
        <b>Scenario #1:</b><br>
         Jack is a local farmer who wants to use the interactive story terrain map to plan his irrigation system. He opens the map and <b>toggles</b> on and off different layers, such as elevation, slope, and soil moisture. As he explores the map, he clicks on a point on the map and <b>retrieves</b> detailed information about the topography of that area to <b>compare</b> the different places, including the elevation and slope. This helps him plan the optimal locations for his irrigation system. He also uses the map to <b>identify</b> potential areas of soil erosion and takes steps to mitigate these risks. 

        <b>Scenario #2:</b> <br>
        John Smith is a resident of Nebraska and he wants to use the interactive story terrain map to better understand the impact of terrain research on his community. He opens the map and <b>toggles</b> on, off, or <b>overlays</b> different layers, such as land use, soil types, and hill shade. As he explores the map, he <b>clicks</b> on a point on the map and <b>retrieves</b> detailed information about the geology and geography of the region. In addition, he clicks the different elevation line graphs to <b>compare</b> the elevation changes through different directions for his area. This helps him understand the importance of terrain research in mitigating the risks of natural hazards such as erosion and landslides, and how it can inform land-use decisions to support sustainable development.
