    2. Scenario
        Scenario #1: A wildlife enthusiast plans a hunting trip in Nebraska and wants to compare and rank the best spots for trophy bucks. They open the interactive story terrain map and select the Nebraska region. As they scroll down the map, they see the sequence of terrain changes throughout the year and begin to identify potential hunting grounds. They click on a point on the map and retrieve the elevation, coordinate, and soil moisture information to better understand the terrain. They also click on a line on the map, which shows the elevation graph on the right side of the screen. This helps them identify the best route for the hunting trip, taking into account the season and potential game in the area.

        Scenario #2: An outdoor adventurer is planning a backpacking trip in the Rocky Mountains and is looking for areas of particular beauty to explore. They use the interactive story terrain map to identify areas such as alpine lakes and mountain passes. They click on a point on the map to retrieve the elevation, coordinate, and soil moisture information to better plan their route and ensure they can access these areas safely. They also use the map to show their friends the changes in weather patterns throughout the year, highlighting the best times to capture stunning images of the natural world. Their friends are impressed by the map's visual representation of the terrain and appreciate their use of technology to enhance their outdoor experience.
